# Description 
"This repository contains a modern implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe, built using React. The game provides a grid interface for two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, with the goal of placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal pattern.

# Key features of this project include:

Interactive gameplay: The game updates in real-time as players make their moves.
Win detection: The application automatically detects when a player has won and announces the winner.
Tie detection: The game can detect a tie (when the entire grid is filled without a winner).
Responsive design: The game board is responsive and adjusts to fit the screen size.
